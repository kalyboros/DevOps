# CT360 DevOps assignment 

DevOps learning module

## Getting Started


## Tasks
### Task 1: Introduction to Groovy and setting up local / Azure environment
I installed Ubuntu 22.04 LTS on VMWare. 

On the newly installed OS i did the initial upgrade and update, installed vsc, did some gnome tweaking, installed jdk and groovy. 

After that i created a .groovy file in which i have my notes and examples from learning groovy (lists, maps, nullsafe, ternary, regex ...).

Created an ubuntu virtual machine on azure (later i deleted it since i dont need it right now and it costs 0.09EUR/hr).

BONUS: I also created a shared library with a simple text output and built it in jenkins.

### Task 2: Introduction to Jenkins (Azure VM)
TO BE DONE

### Task 3: Introduction to Docker (on local or Azure VM)
Successfully installed docker on my VM.

Created an account on Docker Hub.

Difference between a docker image and docker container?
- Docker image is a package that includes everything needed to run as an application and is by itself executable. Information in the image provides on how a container should instantiate, which components to run and what to do with them. 
- Docker container is a virtual enviornment that bundles the application with all the code and dependencies required to run the app. 

Created a dockerfile, which builds an image of TO BE DONE, pushed it to repo which can be seen here TO BE DONE

What i learned about docker compose, swarm, stacks TO BE DONE
